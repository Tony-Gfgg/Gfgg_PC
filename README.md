Note: READ THIS BEFORE USING IT, THIS COMPUTER IS A MESS, AND DOESNT FUNCTION HALF THE TIME (mostly my fault, sorry)



 - What is this?

This a W.I.P project of mine to build my own computer. I chose logisim because it seemed the most professional, has ability to create custom circuits, and more. It functions with a custom assembly language (More
on that later).

- I downloaded the file, how do I open it?

In order to use this, you need Logisim Evolution to be installed. If you don't, just search it up and you'll find a download on Github. Once you open the file in Logisim, you'll be in a circuit called "Gfgg_Full_Adder".
Don't worry, that (and everything else) is from other stuff I was working on. In the circuits window on the top left, scroll down to Gfgg_PC_8. That's the actual computer.

- How does this computer work (and why doesn't it half the time)

This computer runs on a custom assembly language I created called Gfgg Assembly, which is extremely basic. If you want to learn more on it, use the .pdf file I added. Use the binary code next to each instruction, convert
it into hexadecimal, then put it in the computer, it will then run once you start the clock (I know it's a hassle).

Note 2: FOR LOADING VALUES INTO THE REGISTERS, THE "x" bits ARE TO PUT A 4-BIT BINARY NUMBER. YOU CAN GO FROM 0 - 15. ONCE YOU USE THE ADD COMMAND, IT GETS SENT TO THE BUS AND YOU USE THE OUTPUT TO SEE IT.

- I don't know what to do!

Me neither. I know this is limited, but this is very complicated using my botched code and crappy circuit-building skills to make this. If something goes wrong, just go to "Issues", post your problem, and I'll try to help
you (Note on the word "TRY")

- Do you plan on fixing / improving this?

Yes, although this barely works, I do want to spend time fixing it and making this more powerful. I'm still fairly new to digital circuits, so I'm just working through this one at a time. Here are
some plans for what to make in the future.

- Create more instructions (Loading, storing, ALU, etc).
- Support for possibly another coding language
- Atleast get a version of Q-DOS, 86-DOS, or even MS-DOS running.
- MAKE THIS TURING COMPLETE
- MORE RAM

This is a lot to expect, but I will take time learning more to make this more user-friendly. At this stage, I'm just trying to get feedback and reviews.
